Synth Terms of Service

Last Updated: I/W
Proper Usage

Synth demonstrates everything shown in videos on MrJAwesome's youtube page. You may use these commands as you would like within your server as long as what you are doing does not break discord's TOS.

Synth stores channelIDs, guildIDs and userIDs. We will ONLY store said IDs if the bot requires it to complete actions within your server. If you would like to delete your data, disable the systems that store it. You can also join our support server to request personal data deletion.

Consider checking this page frequently, as our TOS may change.
